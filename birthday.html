            <br>
            Two years in, still feels brand new,
            Even when we argue, I still choose you.
            From late night texts to memories kept,
            Jan 14s the night my heart quietly wept.
            <br>
            Distance hurts, but love dont fade,
            Youre still the best choice I ever made.
            Through every fight, every ‚ÄúI miss you‚Äù sigh,
            Its always been you. Itll always be I.</p>
